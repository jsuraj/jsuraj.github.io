Hello, world! I'm Suraj Jagtap, a developer working on JavaScript and Generative AI. This blog marks the start of a new chapter, where I'll be documenting my journey, experiences, and the lessons I learn as I build exciting projects at the intersection of code and AI.

I'll be sharing insights on:

- **Web Development**: From fundamental concepts to advanced patterns and latest APIs in html, css and javascript.
- **Generative AI**: Discussing the latest in AI, sharing tips, and exploring practical applications of AI in development.
- **Building Projects**: Real-world examples and challenges I encounter while working on innovative tools and applications.
